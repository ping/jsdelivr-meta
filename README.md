# What

An archive of jsdelivr's ``info.ini`` / ``update.json`` files as of commit [``4d06fa2``](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/tree/4d06fa2192f4bf7672cd31ff92b074fac8a07456).

# Why

I had problems trying to migrate my old library links to the new [jsdelivr backend](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/#usage) because jsdelivr had purged their original repo and I could no longer tell if the library I used was sourced from [``npm``](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/#npm), [``github``](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/#github), or [``wp``](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/#wordpress).

This archive is an attempt to remedy that by making the meta files available for search again.

# How

Use search or the file finder (press "t" to activate) to locate the library you want. If an ``update.json`` file is available, that will tell you where the library was sourced from. Otherwise, check ``info.ini`` for the homepage and start your hunt from there.
