description = "Tiny polyfill for the placeholder form element attribute. Requires Prototype.js or jQuery. This Prototype JavaScript simulates the placeholder attribute in browsers that do not support it yet. It doesn’t do anying if placeholders are supported, and degrades to show nothing if both placeholder and JavaScript support are missing."
