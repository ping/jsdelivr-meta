description = "A project similar to Markdownify but executed on the client. The ultimate goal is integration with existing WYSIWYG html editors (eg: TinyMCE, CKeditor, Loki, CLeditor) to produce Markdown output. There are currently no WYSIWYG editors for markdown, only WYSIWYM, which still require knowledge of markdown syntax and its many quirky flavors."
