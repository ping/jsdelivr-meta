description = "A Modern JavaScript Date Library. XDate is a thin wrapper around JavaScript's native Date object and provides enhanced functionality for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates. It implements the same methods as the native Date, so it should seem very familiar. Also, it is non-destructive to the DOM, so it can safely be included in third party libraries without fear of side effects."
