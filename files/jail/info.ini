description = "JAIL aka jQuery Asynchronous Image Loader plugin is a lightweight plugin for jQuery (just 4Kb for the minified version), really simple and powerful. It is used when you have got images, which have large dimension, in a page and you do not want to compromise the user experience making the page load slow. The main concept behind this plugin is deferring the loading of the images after the page is loaded. "
