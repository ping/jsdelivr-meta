description = "XRegExp provides augmented and extensible JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax, flags, and methods beyond what browsers support natively. XRegExp is also a regex utility belt with tools to make your client-side grepping simpler and more powerful, while freeing you from worrying about pesky cross-browser inconsistencies and the dubious lastIndex property."
