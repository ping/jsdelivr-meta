description = "remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library, used to enable users of unhosted web apps (JavaScript apps running in a browser) to store their data at a place of their choice (their remoteStorage server).  It tries to get in the way of app developers as little as possible, while providing the easiest path for both developers and users to integrate their storage with apps."
