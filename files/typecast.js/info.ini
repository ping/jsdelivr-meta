description = "In a sentence, Typecast solves all the simple problems, so you can focus on the big ones. Typecast fixes what's wrong with Javascript by creating a complete platform for strongly-typed variables in Javascript. It works both in a browser and on Node.js servers. Typecast pairs well with jQuery by providing strongly typed variables without altering Javascript's native prototypes or requiring a custom compiler such as CoffeeScript, TypeScript or Clojure. "
