description = "Twitter Bootstrap's current modal has a fixed height and scrolls long content inside of it. This version of the plugin, along with some minimal CSS allows you to have a modal that acts more like Facebook and Trello modals, where the content can be any height and the whole page scrolls, rather than internal scrollbars in the modal."
