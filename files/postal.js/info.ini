description = "Postal.js is an in-memory message bus - very loosely inspired by AMQP - written in JavaScript. Postal.js runs in the browser, or on the server-side using Node.js. It takes the familiar eventing-style paradigm (of which most JavaScript developers are familiar) and extends it by providing broker and subscriber implementations which are more sophisticated than what you typically find in simple event delegation."
